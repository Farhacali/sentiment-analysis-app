# Sentiment Analysis App 🧠💬

This project is a **Sentiment Analysis App** built using Python and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It allows you to analyze the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of user-provided text inputs.

## 📁 Project Overview

This app demonstrates:
- Text preprocessing
- Vectorization using TF-IDF
- Sentiment classification using a machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression)
- Evaluation metrics for performance
- User-friendly interface via Jupyter/Colab

## 🚀 Features

- Input any English text and get the predicted **sentiment**
- Preprocessing pipeline including:
  - Lowercasing
  - Punctuation removal
  - Stopword filtering
  - Lemmatization
- Trained model with evaluation metrics (accuracy, confusion matrix)
- Fully interactive in Google Colab

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- NLTK / spaCy (for NLP preprocessing)
- Google Colab (for development)

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Open the notebook in **Google Colab**:
   - [Click to open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Farhacali/sentiment-analysis-app/blob/main/cleaned_sentiment_analysis_app.ipynb)
2. Run each cell in sequence
3. Enter your own text in the prediction section to analyze its sentiment

## 📝 Example

```text
Input: "I love this product! It's amazing and works great."
Output: Positive
